# This is the Argon Admin Dashboard

It uses React.js, Vite, Material UI with a Dark and Light Mode

Along with the main dashboard page, it displays the teams page with default emails and phone numbers, invoices balance page, profile form page, calendar page, and multiple other charts with their purposes being to display default data. 

This is a repo that I took and followed along watching a video and making subtle changes to it.
